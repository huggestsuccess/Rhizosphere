King Oyster Mushroom - Pleurotus Eryngii - Mushroom spawn for wood logs
Certified for organic mushroom cultivation according to Regulation EC 834/2007 and 889/2008
(Organic control station: AT-BIO-301, Austria Bio Garantie)
1 autoclave bag approx. 3 kg - 6 liter
Suitable for inoculation of 25 to 30 linear meters of wood.

You receive ready colonized mushroom spawn made from organic raw material (wood, rye bran from organic farming) for inoculation of wood logs. Suitable woods are poplar, oak, alder, aspen, maple, birch, ash, beech, willow or elm.
Fruiting season for this strain is late summer to early autumn.

For quantities of 10 or more logs inoculation with sawdust spawn is usually more efficient than working with dowels. Sawdust is a byproduct and more cost efficient and environmentaly sustainable than dowels that have to be produced. Because of this large quantities of spawn can be produced for a lower price. Sawdust spawn is suitable for the borehole inoculation method and the cutting inoculation method. Expected harvest yield is up to 10 % of the fresh woods weight divided on several flushes over 3 to 5 years.

For the borehole-method we recommend the usage of a mushroom drill, and an inoculation stick or a hand inoculator.
Larger quantities for commercial mushroom growing on request.
